<h2>
<a id="summary" class="anchor" href="#summary" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>SUMMARY</h2>

<p>We are going to implement a Python module for helping programmers to parallelize their code by comments, like “#pragma omp parallel for” tag  in OpenMP.</p>

<p>Our target is making the module based on pure Python, so users will not need to acquire other frameworks except installing our module.</p>

<h2>
<a id="background" class="anchor" href="#background" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>BACKGROUND</h2>

<p>One of  promising features of OpenMP is the easiness to make . All it needs is annotations to tag the block to be in parallel. Due to Global Interpreter Lock mechanism in Python, to our best knowledge, there is no naive way which enables standard Python to integrate with OpenMP. The programmers need to learn Cython language or new parallel Python frameworks, which spends much extra effort. </p>

<p>We plan to design a python-to-python compiler which translates original python code to a parallelized code: from tagged for loop code to multi-process code (like Pool().map()). With our “compiler”, the users can make their code into parallelized code easily by adding just annotations near the for loop. </p>

<p>We think that the programs with cpu intensive jobs on multiple data can benefit from PyMP. Because we plan to uses multi-process to run a for loop in parallel, in which multi-process can generate overhead(e.g. scattering variables, gathering return values). If the computation is light in each iteration, PyMP may spend most of time to make it run in multi-process and cannot get beneficial from parallel running. On the other side, the cpu intensive jobs can get beneficial from multi-process in parallel, like Mandelbort.</p>

<h2>
<a id="the-challenge" class="anchor" href="#the-challenge" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>THE CHALLENGE</h2>

<p>“Compile” code blocks with annotation into parallel code. Currently we plan to apply a 3-steps methodology. First, functions in our module check for any recognizable annotations and re-write corresponding blocks into parallel functions. Second, link this parallel functions back into the original code to replace the old blocks and add any necessary control checks. Third, do normal compile or directly execute the modified Python code.
Implement basic scheduling mechanism. We should at least support reasonable static scheduler. If possible, we would like to try to support dynamical scheduler as well.</p>

<h2>
<a id="resources" class="anchor" href="#resources" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>RESOURCES</h2>

<p>One server in GHC with 8-16 cores would be enough for our project.</p>

<p>We have implemented MPI-version kmeans in Python in last semester 15649 course. Maybe we can use it to do some experiments for comparison.</p>

<h2>
<a id="goals-and-deliverables" class="anchor" href="#goals-and-deliverables" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>GOALS AND DELIVERABLES</h2>

<ul>
<li>We will develop a “compiler” which can translate a Python code in parallel</li>
<li>We will compare the speedup curve between our auto-generated code and sophisticated hand crafted code in several applications</li>
<li>We hope to develop some sophisticated parallel options for users to specify (e.g. dynamic scheduling)</li>
<li>We hope to compare the speedup curve between our our auto-generated code and c openmp code in several applications</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="platform-choice" class="anchor" href="#platform-choice" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>PLATFORM CHOICE</h2>

<p>Python, because it is a widely used programming language. </p>
