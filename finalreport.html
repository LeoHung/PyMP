                We developed EazyMP, a python-to-python translator supporting OpenMP [2] style annotation to make sequential code run in parallel. User can utilize mutiple cores with least effort to run code faster!
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
                EazyMP is tested on GHC server (with 6 cores) and latedays server (with 12 cores) with several test scripts "BusyLoop", "Mandelbrot" and file grep.
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
                According to the experiments, we show that EazyMP can provide up to N/2x ~ Nx (N is the number of cores) speedup comparing to sequential code.

              <p class="lead">
                One of the promising features in OpenMP is the easiness to program. All programers need to do is adding annotations to tag the block to parallel. Due to Global Interpreter Lock mechanism in Python, to our best knowledge, there is no easy way which enables standard Python to integrate with OpenMP. The programmers need to learn Cython language or new parallel Python frameworks, which takes much extra effort.
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
                EazyMP is a python-to-python compiler which transforms original python code to a parallelized version: "for" loop code to multi-process code (like Pool().map()).
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
                With our “compiler”, the users can optimize the code to its parallelized version easily by just adding annotations on the for loop.
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
                We think cpu intensive programs process multiple data can benefit from EazyMP the most. Like Mandelbort. In other scenario, program can still take advantage of multiple cores but abuse of EazyMP may also generate extra overheads (e.g. scattering variables, gathering return values).

              <h3>Add Syntax</h3>
              <p class="lead">
                EazyMP's syntax style is inspired by OpenMP: user just needs to add annotations on the block to be parallelized. (1) Add "#pragma omp parallel for" nearby the for-loop to run the loop in parallel, and (2) add "#pragma shared" to indicate which variable is shared among processes.

                Openmp uses multi-thread for parallelism. However, EazyMP is based on multi-process. Why do we choose process based parallelism?
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
                There are some other possible options:
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
                <b>Thread parallelism</b> Native Python thread requires GIL before running. So only a single thread can be active at a time in the Python interpreter.
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
                <b>Cython extension</b> Cython [3] helps to add C extensions in Python program. So programmers can potentially use C thread lib for parallelism. Although it’s a feasible way, it requires programmers learn Cython, and C language. And the program tends to be complicated when Cython is used. What is worse, programmer may need to refactor all existing code if he want to add parallelism.
              </p>
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              So <b>process based solution is a reasonable choice.</b> According to our experiment, Python processes can parallel the program in multiple-core host. It meets our need.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              However, there are 2 problems for using process based approach.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              1. Process is heavier than thread. So overhead of using process is higher.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              2. Processes share nothing. So it would be hard to share data between parallel instances. For example, reading data in the parallel part requires data to be dispatched to the processes. Writing data in the parallel part will need a collecting phase, so that the following sequential part can see changes.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              Despite the overheads and limitations, process based methods makes true parallelism in Python possible. The performance of the program increases with multiple process execution.
              EazyMP hides multiprocess detail. And it also tries to reduce the overheads.

                EazyMP provides another syntax to indicate shared variables: "#pragma shared dict reduce".
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
                Instead of using "multiprocess.Manager" to provide shared variable process, "#pragma shared dict reduce" lets each process access it's local variable first, and then aggregates them after for-loop finishes.
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
                EazyMP translator first adds __shared__ dictionary into core function. The operations related to the shared variable will be redirect to the __shared__ variable, and the core function will return __shared__ variable finally. EazyMP will add a block of code to reduce __shared__ variables into the original varible.
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
                This approach can reduce synchronization overhead, because the processes does not truly shared variables.

                Like OpenMP uses "atomic{}" closure to limit only one thread can access critical section, EazyMP provides Atomic context to let only one process can access the code in the specific block.

              <p class="lead">
                User needs to import Atomic class from EazyMP library. Atomic is context class but do nothing. It is just a anchor point for EazyMP to detect.

              <p class="lead">
                When EazyMP detects Atomic class, it will use "multiprocess.Manager" to provide a lock. Only the process with the lock can access the critical section.

              <h3>CPU intensive tasks</h3>

                <p class="lead">
                We first test EazyMP with two CPU intensive tasks: busyloop and mandelbrot [1]. These type of tasks consume CPU computation rather than memory fetching. We can examine EazyMP performance without worring other factors(e.g., memory bandwidth, disk I/O, network I/O) with these tasks.
              </p>

              <p class="lead">
                BusyLoop runs i++ 500 times inside a for-loop. i is a local variable, so does not have any synchronization requirment.
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
                Mandelbrot is invested by Pierre Fatou and Gaston Julia. It also requires much CPU comutation but less memory communication. In our test, we compute 1000 * 1000 mandelbrot graph.
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
                According the experiment result, EazyMP can provide reasonable speedup.
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
                Notice that although latedays server has more cores, its performance for Mandelbrot is lower than GHC server. The reason is because latedays server has slower CPU (2.4 GHz). GHC server's CPU is 3.2 GHz. In Mandelbrot, the reducer process needs to merge intermediate results. So shower CPU makes the reducer process spend more time on merging. The result is less speedup.
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
                On the other hand, BusyLoop is pure CPU intensive task, so EazyMP scales pretty good in our tests.

              <p></p>
              <p class="lead">
                A typical use case of processing a big file is grep. We write a test script that scans large file for any lines that contain the input word.
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
                Naive version of this script will read each line in the file and do a search in these lines. In order to use EazyMP, the script is modified to strips the whole file into small block areas before scan. Then it checks each block in a for loop. The loop itself will not cause computing overhead. But it enables adding EazyMP annotation. So EazyMP will create process for each block area and scan the lines in these block in parallel.
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
                We used a 2GB text file for testing the script. The speedup is shown above. As we increase the process number, the speedup could be up to 5x in a 6 cores server and up to 11x in 12 cores server.
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
                Notice in 6 cores server test, the performance of the program is lower when there are too much processes created. This causes management overhead. In 12 cores server, we believe the management overhead is still lower than the parallel benefit.
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
                Of cause, in this case, the performance of the script is also affected by the size of block. Big size blocks reduce parallelism, small size blocks increase management overhead. The result we show in this report uses an optimized block size (400 KB) according to our experiment.

              <p class="lead">
                Another typical use case is processing a large amount of files. For example, scan in the log folder. The scan script can potentially check every log files in parallel. But programmer usually do it in a loop for quick development. Now they just add EazyMP annotation after the for loop.
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
                In this example, we do grep on 110 files, each with size around 50MB. The script checks all files (or the files in subdirectories) for lines that contain the input word. Each file is processed in a separate process by EazyMP. The result is shown above.
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
                We notice the speedup is even better than the processing single file example. We think this is because, different from the previous case, there is no overhead for striping the input in this test. The program performance shows that EazyMP has basically maximized the parallel speedup.

                Besides performance, this test also verifies EazyMP can handle nested loop. As long as the system has resource for new process fork, the nested loop can be handled in parallel as well.

              <h3>Frequent Synchronization Tests</h3>
              <p></p>
              <p class="lead">
                Previous tests don’t need synchronization. However, it’s a common requirement for parallel program. For example, if we want to do "word count" in multiple files, the count has to be synchronously updated frequently. In EazyMP, there are 2 ways for this task. First option is using atomic method. Second option is using “shared reduce” annotation on the variables.
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
                We tested these 2 methods using a word count script on hundreds of small text files. Every process scan a single file. We conducted experiments on Latedays machine.
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
                In order to use atomic method in this script, the developer has to specify which block in the code would update the shared count records. Then EazyMP will ensure atomicity by using lock. The result shows that lock causes a lot of overheads and the performance actually decreases when add EazyMP support. Multi-process version "word count" can be 368.73 times slower than sequential version using 12 processes.
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
                We think there are 2 main reasons cause this performance decreasing. First, different processes compete for the same lock. So when they frequently ask for entering the critical block, multiple processes would be blocked. Second, process based solution causes extra overheads compared with thread based solution. Both lock and shared variable updates are actually Inter Process Communication (IPC), which is much slower than communication between threads that in the same process.
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
                Next, if choose to use “shared reduce” method, the developer needs to add annotation "#pragma shared dict reduce" on the count dictionary. Then EazyMP will help to aggregate the result. The result shows that when there are too many items in the dict, script performance will decrease. Multi-process version (12 processes) code is about 8x slower than sequential code.
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
                The performance issue is mainly caused by IPC cost and the "reducing" phase. Beside IPC cost, the master process needs to merge all intermediate results generated by subprocesses. If intermediate results are huge, the time that master process spends on merging would be more than the time that is saved by using multi-process.
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
                Based on our experiments, although these 2 methods can ensure the correctness, we think developers should not use EazyMP in the programs that have frequent synchronization requirement.
